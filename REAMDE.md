# General

Project of Techlabs group 9 in the year 2020. 


# Project

The project is about implementing an AI program which is able to listen to
conversations and analyze these by various means.


# Installation instructions

From the projects root directory (the parent directory of this README file),
run

* On Windows: `python install.py`
* On Linux / Mac: `python3 install.py`

The installation script will create a virtual Python environment for you and
install all Python packages necessary into it. Also, on Linux and Mac, the
**PATH** environment variable is automatically extended such that project
internal imports can be resolved by the Python interpreter. On the Windows
platform, this step has to be carried out manually by the user. In this case,
the *install.py* script tells the user which value this environment variable
should get.
