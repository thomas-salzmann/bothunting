# General

This folder contains utility modules which contain code that does not represent
the core functionality of the project, but rather plays a supportive role for
the core code.

Utility modules might be modules which help manipulating file system paths
(pathutil.py) or give access to operating system functionality such as creating
and deleting files and directories or changing permissions on a file or
directory (osutil.py).
